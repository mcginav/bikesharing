# bikesharing

Most bikes, more than 145,000, were used for a duration of 6 minutes or less. This suggests that most of the rentals were used for quick trips not long, leisurely bike rides through the city.

The majority of bikes were used during commute hours -  8am-10am and 5pm to 7pm; Monday-Friday.

Saturday was also a popular day for rentals. 

Bikesharing is popular with the male population in NYC. They are taking bikes out for those short trips of 6 minutes or less.
This data suggests that men are using the bikes for quick trips on weekday evenings. After work is a good time to jump on a bike, get to the transit station, and head home. It's faster than walking and they might beat some of the other commuters for a seat on the subway.

Using the data from the map query from our previous work, I narrowed down the information to find the top 5 starting and ending locations. The data shows that most of the bikes, more than 16,000, started and ended at Pershing Square North Station. 

 I would like to explore the data futher to find out what time the bikes were checked out at the station and what time they were returned. My theory is that commuters are checking out the bikes to head to work, using them for that 5 minute trip, then getting on a bike at the end of the day to head back to the station.

I would like to explore the data to see if the people renting bikes on the weekends rented them for longer durations than on the weekdays.
